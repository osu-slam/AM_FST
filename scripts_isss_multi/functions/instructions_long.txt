Welcome to our experiment! Press middle finger button to continue. 
Press middle finger button to continue through instructions.
Press index finger button to go back.
Speak up anytime during instructions if anything is unclear--we can hear you!
There are 16 trials in each run of this experiment. 
In each trial, you will be presented one of three types of stimuli:
1) A sentence read by a female speaker,
2) Noise, like someone is blowing into a microphone,
3) or silence. 
If you hear noise, do not press any buttons. 
If you hear a sentence, please respond as follows:
Each sentence will involve two people; one male and one female. 
Think about who is performing the action (i.e. the actor) of the sentence. 
For example: please say who the actor is in the following three sentences.
Girls who boys visit are content. (Are the girls or the boys doing the visiting?)
Males who support females are endearing. (Are the males or females doing the supporting?)
Princesses that princes marry are wealthy. 
Great job!
Rather than speaking during the scan, you will respond with a button press. 
If the actor is female, press your middle finger button. 
If the actor is male, press your index finger button. 
Please stare at the fixation cross on screen during each run. 
Before we begin the main experiment, we have a short training exercise for you. 
Do your best to answer quickly and correctly to each sentence. 
If you take too long to answer, your response will not count. 
Remember--Female actor, press your middle finger. Male actor, press your index finger. 
Any questions? If not, press your index finger when you're ready to begin.
