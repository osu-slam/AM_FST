Press middle finger button to continue through instructions.
Press index finger button to go back.
You will be presented one of three types of stimuli:
1) A sentence read by a female speaker,
2) Noise, like someone is blowing into a microphone,
3) or silence. 
If you hear noise, randomly press a button. 
If you hear a sentence, please respond as follows:
Each sentence will involve two people; one male and one female. 
Think about who is performing the action (i.e. the actor) of the sentence. 
If the actor is female, press your index finger. 
If the actor is male, press your middle finger. 
Please stare at the fixation cross on screen during each run. 
Before we begin the main experiment, we have a short training exercise for you. 
Do your best to answer quickly and correctly to each sentence. 
If you take too long to answer, your response will not count. 
Remember--Female actor, press your index finger. Male actor, press your middle finger. 
Any questions? If not, press your middle finger when you're ready to begin.
